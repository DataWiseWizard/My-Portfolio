## 📖 Strategic Intent
This portfolio is not merely a gallery of links. [cite_start]It is a **Hybrid-Narrative Application** designed to demonstrate "Architectural Judgment" and "Professional Character"[cite: 2]. 

[cite_start]It implements the **"Tactile Maximalism"** design paradigm [cite: 30][cite_start], utilizing high-fidelity micro-interactions and kinetic typography to create a "lingering experience" [cite: 14] that distinguishes the developer in an AI-saturated market.

## 🏗 Technical Spine
[cite_start]The application is built on a high-performance stack designed for **LCP < 1.2s** and **100/100 Lighthouse Scores**[cite: 90].

* **Framework:** [Next.js 15 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/) - Utilizing Server Components for zero-bundle-size rendering.
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For mobile-first, atomic utility styling.
* **Animation:** [GSAP (GreenSock)](https://gsap.com/) - GPU-accelerated kinetic typography and scrollytelling.
* **State:** React Hooks & Zustand - For managing simulation logic and audio states.
* **Deployment:** Vercel Edge Network.

## 🧩 The "Rule of Five" Architecture
[cite_start]Following the strategic framework, this portfolio curates five specific projects to demonstrate a complete "T-Shaped" skill set[cite: 17].

| Project | Domain | Narrative Focus | Technical Proof |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pinch** | AI/ML Integration | "The Pinterest Protocol" | Gemini 1.5 Flash, Vector Search |
| **SE-Docx** | Security & Systems | "The Zero-Leak Protocol" | AES-256-GCM, Audit Logs |
| **Drone Lab** | Robotics R&D | "Latency vs. Accuracy" | WebSocket Telemetry Simulation |
| **Clinic OS** | Real-Time Web | "Moving from Chaos to Sync" | Firebase, RBAC, Dashboards |
| **Visual Lab** | Creative Engineering | "Sonic Canvas" | Web Audio API, Canvas 60fps |

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Kinetic Hero:** A scroll-triggered typography opening that establishes the "AI-Native" identity immediately.
* [cite_start]**Bento Grid 2.0:** A naturally responsive, modular grid layout for high scannability of skills and receipts[cite: 59].
* **Simulation Terminal:** A live-rendering React component that mimics drone telemetry logs to prove R&D activity.
* [cite_start]**Conversational Contact Funnel:** A multi-step lead generation form replacing static mailto links[cite: 104].
* **Encryption Visualizer:** A Framer Motion component explaining stream-based cryptography.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-2026.git](https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-2026.git)
    cd portfolio-2026
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```

## 📂 Directory Structure
The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles within the Next.js App Router:

src/
├── app/
│   ├── case-studies/    # Deep-dive micro-sites (Pinch, SE-Docx, etc.)
│   ├── layout.tsx       # Global "Dark Mode Evolution" theme
│   └── page.tsx         # Main "Role Compression" landing page

│   └── security/        # Encryption Pipeline visualizations
└── lib/                 # Shared utilities and GSAP registry


## 🎨 Design Philosophy
* [cite_start]**Role Compression:** The Hero section identifies the candidate within 5 seconds[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Dark Mode Evolution:** Uses "Midnight Black" (#121212) to reduce eye strain[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]**Smarter Micro-interactions:** Every click and hover provides tactile feedback (scale, glow, haptic)[cite: 62].
